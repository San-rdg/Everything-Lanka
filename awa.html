        <h2>‚ö†Ô∏è Common Scams & What to Watch Out For</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fake Tour Guides:</strong> Some individuals near tourist attractions may pose as guides. They might offer unsolicited help and later demand payment. Always go with licensed guides or book tours through trusted platforms.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Gem Scams:</strong> Be wary of people offering to sell you ‚Äúrare‚Äù or ‚Äúvaluable‚Äù gems at a discount. Many of these are either fake or vastly overpriced. Only buy from reputable shops certified by the Sri Lanka Gem & Jewellery Authority.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Tuk Tuk Overcharging:</strong> Some drivers might avoid using the meter and charge inflated rates. Politely insist on using the meter or agree on a fair price beforehand. Apps like PickMe and Uber are great alternatives.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Fake Monks:</strong> Occasionally, scammers dressed as monks ask for donations or try to sell amulets. Genuine Buddhist monks never beg for money or sell items.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Temple Entry Fees:</strong> Be cautious around temples where unofficial individuals may charge tourists a fake entrance fee. Official sites will have signs with prices and tickets issued by staff.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Currency Exchange Tricks:</strong> Avoid exchanging money at random roadside stalls or with strangers. Some may give poor rates or shortchange you. Always use banks or licensed money exchangers.</li>
            
            <li><strong>‚ÄúFriendly Local‚Äù Trap:</strong> A stranger may be overly friendly and invite you to a tea shop, restaurant, or store where you are pressured to buy things at inflated prices. Be polite, but cautious with such invitations.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Wildlife Photo Scams:</strong> People may offer to let you take photos with animals like monkeys or snakes, then demand large payments after. These animals may be poorly treated, and this practice should be discouraged.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><em>üåø Remember: Sri Lankans are warm and welcoming by nature. Most locals you meet will be genuine and kind ‚Äî just stay alert, trust your instincts, and enjoy your journey with confidence!</em></p>
