<h1>Top Best Snacks of Sri Lanka - 2025</h1>

<h2>1. Mari Biscuit</h2>
<p>Oh boy, where to start. Mari biscuit is probably the foundational snack of an average Sri Lankan. No matter your age everyone in Sri Lanka enjoys the sweet wheaty taste of beautifully carved Mari biscuit.</p>
<p>Mari, being a biscuit related to locals' childhood, has won many hearts and taste buds all over Sri Lanka and still to this day continues to be a best seller.</p>
<p>We would say that it is one of the <strong>best snacks of Sri Lanka</strong>, when compared to others. Today you have Mari biscuits ranging from chocolate flavoured ones to purely wheat based and milk flavoured varieties.</p>
<p>But nothing beats the taste of the good old original Mari biscuit. This is a must-try snack if you are visiting Sri Lanka. You can purchase Mari biscuits from pretty much any small shop or supermarket.</p>
<p><strong>Fun Tip :</strong> Try dipping your Mari biscuits in a cup of milk tea.</p>

<h2>2. Achcharu</h2>
<p>Without a doubt, what I consider to be one of the <strong>best snacks of Sri Lanka</strong>, is <strong>"Achcharu"</strong>.</p>
<p>Different kinds of fruit cut up into small bits and mixed with chilli, salt, pepper, sugar and a bit of vinegar. It could be spicy, sour, sweet or both. The taste of an Achcharu is to die for.</p>
<p>Some of the favourite and most popular Achcharus in Sri Lanka are Veralu Achcharu, Nelli Achcharu, Jambu Achcharu, Mango Achcharu, Diwul (Wood Apple) Achcharu and Annasi (Pineapple) Achcharu. You will mostly find these Achcharus beside the road sold by street vendors.</p>
<p>We advise you to be cautious when buying Achcharu from street vendors as quality and hygiene are not guaranteed. We recommend either purchasing from a vendor who has a lot of customers or asking locals for the best quality Achcharu.</p>
<p><strong>Be Warned :</strong> Achcharu tends to be very spicy as they are prepared for the locals.</p>

<h2>3. Lemon Puff</h2>
<p>The most original biscuit of Sri Lanka ladies and gentlemen. Lemon flavoured icing placed perfectly between two soft-to-touch and crunchy biscuits. It’s light, zesty, and considered one of the <strong>best snacks of Sri Lanka</strong> to enjoy with your evening tea.</p>

<h2>4. Isso Wade</h2>
<p>A street food icon and easily one of the <strong>best snacks of Sri Lanka</strong>! Isso Wade is a crispy, deep-fried lentil patty topped with spicy prawns (Isso). It’s usually served hot by street vendors, especially near Galle Face Green. The crunchy texture combined with the kick of spice makes it an unforgettable experience.</p>
<p>This snack holds a legendary reputation among locals and tourists alike. Many consider it a must-try when sampling the <strong>best snacks of Sri Lanka</strong> for its bold flavours and perfect seaside setting. It’s best enjoyed fresh, with a squeeze of lime, while watching the sunset at the beach.</p>
<p><strong>Hot Tip :</strong> Try it with a splash of lime juice on top — absolute heaven!</p>

<h2>5. Kimbula Banis</h2>
<p>Kimbula Banis, affectionately called the ‘Crocodile Bun’ because of its elongated shape, is a much-loved bakery classic in Sri Lanka. It’s a slightly sweet, soft bread roll glazed generously with crunchy sugar crystals on top. Its chewy texture and crackly sugar crust make it a simple yet addictive afternoon treat and undoubtedly one of the <strong>best snacks of Sri Lanka</strong>.</p>
<p>This humble snack is often eaten alongside a steaming cup of Ceylon tea, either plain or with butter. Schoolchildren, office workers, and anyone seeking a quick sugar fix love grabbing a Kimbula Banis from their local bakery. During monsoon rains, enjoying one while watching the drizzle is an unmatched Lankan experience.</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip :</strong> Ask your bakery for a fresh batch — warm Kimbula Banis are even softer and more aromatic.</p>

<h2>6. Fish Rolls</h2>
<p>A popular snack at parties and bakeries, Fish Rolls are deep-fried pastries filled with spiced fish and vegetable stuffing. Crispy on the outside and savoury on the inside — you can’t stop at one! It rightfully earns a place among the <strong>best snacks of Sri Lanka</strong>.</p>
<p>Available in almost every bakery on the island, Fish Rolls offer a perfect balance of textures and spices, making them a go-to snack for locals on the move.</p>
<p><strong>Warning :</strong> Best enjoyed fresh, as the crispiness fades if left too long.</p>

<h2>7. Milk Toffee</h2>
<p>One of Sri Lanka’s most beloved homemade sweets, Milk Toffee is a creamy, fudge-like confection made by slow-cooking condensed milk, sugar, and butter until thick, then adding roasted cashew nuts and cardamom for extra flavour. It’s then set in a tray and cut into squares once cooled.</p>
<p>The rich, velvety texture of Milk Toffee makes it melt in your mouth, while the slight crunch of cashews adds a delightful contrast. It’s a must-have at Sinhala and Tamil New Year tables, birthdays, and weddings. It also ranks high as one of the <strong>best snacks of Sri Lanka</strong> for those with a sweet tooth.</p>
<p><strong>Warning :</strong> It’s dangerously addictive — most people can’t stop at just one piece!</p>

<h2>8. Manioc Chips</h2>
<p>If you’re searching for a crunchy, spicy snack that perfectly represents the island’s street food culture, Manioc Chips should top your list of the <strong>best snacks of Sri Lanka</strong>. Thinly sliced cassava (manioc) is deep fried until golden and sprinkled generously with chilli salt. A great alternative to regular potato chips!</p>
<p>Available in street stalls, supermarkets and bus stands, these fiery crisps pair brilliantly with an ice-cold ginger beer on a hot day.</p>

<h2>9. Kokis</h2>
<p>Kokis is a traditional deep-fried delicacy made with rice flour and coconut milk, giving it a light, crispy texture. The batter is dipped into a decorative metal mould, then fried in hot oil until golden brown. The resulting snack is crunchy, delicate, and often subtly flavoured with turmeric or cumin seeds.</p>
<p>It’s especially popular during the Sinhala and Tamil New Year season and is one of the <strong>best snacks of Sri Lanka</strong> associated with festive traditions. Almost every household makes it to serve to visiting guests and family.</p>
<p><strong>Curious Fact :</strong> Despite its crispiness, Kokis isn’t sweet — it’s a neutral snack that pairs well with tea or even with a side of spicy sambal.</p>
