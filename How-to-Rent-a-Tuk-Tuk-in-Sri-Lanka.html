    <h2>How to Rent a Tuk Tuk in Sri Lanka</h2>
    <p>
      Renting a tuk tuk in Sri Lanka has become a popular and adventurous way for tourists to explore the island. It gives you complete freedom to go off the beaten track, visit hidden gems, and experience daily life like a local. But before you jump into the driver’s seat, there are a few things you need to know.
    </p>

    <h2>Can Tourists Drive Tuk Tuks in Sri Lanka?</h2>
    <p>
      Yes, tourists are legally allowed to drive tuk tuks in Sri Lanka — but only if they hold the correct licenses. You must possess an International Driving Permit (IDP) along with a Sri Lankan recognition permit, which is issued by the Automobile Association of Ceylon (AAC). Some tuk tuk rental companies can help arrange this for you.
    </p>

    <h2>How to Get the Sri Lankan Recognition Permit</h2>
    <p>
      The process is relatively quick and inexpensive. You’ll need to present your original driver’s license, your IDP, a passport-sized photo, and a copy of your passport. Visit the AAC office in Colombo or arrange it via your rental company (some charge a small service fee).
    </p>

    <h2>How Much Does It Cost to Rent a Tuk Tuk?</h2>
    <p>
      Most rental companies charge between <strong>$15–$25 USD per day</strong>. Some even offer long-term discounts or bundle insurance and SIM card options. Be sure to check if fuel, insurance, breakdown support, and helmets are included.
    </p>

    <h2>Where to Rent Tuk Tuks in Sri Lanka</h2>
    <p>
      Reputable rental companies include:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>TukTukRental.com</strong> – Great customer support and sustainable travel focus.</li>
        <li><strong>Lanka Adventure Tuk Tuks</strong> – Local expert guides and packages.</li>
        <li><strong>PickMe</strong> – Offers short-term self-drive tuk tuk hire in major cities.</li>
      </ul>
      Always read reviews, check insurance coverage, and inspect the tuk tuk before renting.
    </p>

    <h2>Is Driving a Tuk Tuk Difficult?</h2>
    <p>
      Not really! Tuk tuks have manual transmission but are easier to master than motorcycles. Most companies offer a 30-minute driving lesson before you hit the road. Traffic can be chaotic in cities, so start in a quieter town like Negombo or Ella.
    </p>

    <h2>Rules and Safety Tips</h2>
    <p>
      - Drive on the <strong>left-hand side</strong> of the road.<br />
      - Carry your driving documents and passport at all times.<br />
      - Avoid driving after dark, especially on rural or unlit roads.<br />
      - Use Google Maps or offline GPS apps for navigation.<br />
      - Always wear a helmet (if on a scooter/tuk tuk with open sides).<br />
    </p>

    <h2>Pros and Cons of Renting a Tuk Tuk</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Pros:</strong><br />
      - Total freedom and flexibility<br />
      - Authentic cultural experience<br />
      - Cheaper than long-distance taxis<br />
