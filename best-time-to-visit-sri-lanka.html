    <h2>🌞 Overview: When is the Best Time to Travel Sri Lanka?</h2>
    <p>
      Sri Lanka is a year-round destination blessed with tropical climates, diverse landscapes, and rich cultural heritage. However, understanding the best time to travel Sri Lanka is essential for making the most of your journey. The island experiences two monsoon systems affecting different regions at different times, which allows travelers to chase sunshine and good weather any month of the year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Generally, the best time to travel Sri Lanka’s western and southern coasts, along with the hill country, is from <strong>December to March</strong>, while the eastern and northern coasts shine between <strong>May and September</strong>.

  <section class="section">
    <h2>🌦️ Monsoon Patterns & Regional Climate</h2>
    <p>
      Sri Lanka’s climate is dictated by two monsoon seasons:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Southwest (Yala) Monsoon:</strong> Affects the west, southwest, and hill country from <strong>May to September</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>Northeast (Maha) Monsoon:</strong> Impacts the east, north, and ancient cities from <strong>October to January</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This unique weather pattern means there’s always a side of the island offering dry, sunny days — one reason why travel experts call Sri Lanka a <em>year-round escape</em>. If you’re aiming for the <strong>best time to travel Sri Lanka</strong> for beach vacations or wildlife safaris, aligning with these monsoon patterns is crucial.
