<p class="last-updated">üïí Last updated: July 19, 2025</p>

<h2>1. Kandy</h2>
<p>Famed for the Temple of the Tooth Relic, Kandy is a sacred city and a UNESCO site. Don't miss the Peradeniya Botanical Gardens, the Kandy Lake, and the vibrant Esala Perahera festival. A must for culture lovers and spiritual travelers.</p>

<p>Beyond cultural landmarks, Kandy offers scenic train rides and spice gardens that are perfect for nature lovers.</p>
<p>The cooler climate is ideal for relaxing walks and escaping the coastal heat, especially during the middle months of the year.</p>


<h2>2. Galle</h2>
<p>This southern gem offers the perfectly preserved Galle Fort, quirky boutique hotels, and some of the country‚Äôs most beautiful beaches like Unawatuna. A favorite for architecture buffs, surfers, and digital nomads alike.</p>

<p>Galle's tourism economy has led to an increase in online imports, especially by small business owners and boutique stores ordering stock for resale.</p>
<p>Packages with cosmetics, bags, and mobile phones often attract attention from customs if declared value is unusually low.</p>
<p>For personal use, make sure your parcel doesn‚Äôt resemble a commercial shipment‚Äîmix item categories or keep quantities minimal.</p>
<p>Explore Dutch-era architecture, charming cobblestone streets, and cafes with a view of the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>Galle is a haven for artists and writers, with a growing scene of local galleries, bookshops, and wellness spaces.</p>


<h2>3. Nuwara Eliya</h2>
<p>Often called "Little England" for its colonial charm, Nuwara Eliya boasts tea plantations, waterfalls, and cool weather. Key activities include visiting Horton Plains, hiking to World's End, and touring tea factories like Pedro Estate.</p>
<p>The town's colonial charm is best experienced at the Grand Hotel and its English-style gardens.</p>

<p>Try a cooking class or a traditional Sri Lankan massage after a long hike to unwind.</p>

<h2>5. Anuradhapura</h2>
<p>One of the island‚Äôs ancient capitals, Anuradhapura is dotted with giant stupas, monasteries, and sacred Bodhi trees. Ideal for history enthusiasts, it's a serene, sacred space with fewer tourists than more commercial destinations.</p>
<p>Rent a bicycle to explore the ancient city at your own pace ‚Äî it's the best way to soak in the historic surroundings.</p>
<p>Visit the sacred Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi, said to be the oldest living tree planted by humans with a recorded history.</p>

<h2>6. Jaffna</h2>
<p>Once overlooked, Jaffna is now a top destination for those seeking Tamil culture, authentic cuisine, and historic Hindu temples. Take a boat to Delft Island or chill at Casuarina Beach for a different Sri Lankan vibe.</p>
<p>Jaffna‚Äôs food scene is unmatched ‚Äî try crab curry, dosai, and fresh palmyrah juice at local eateries.</p>
<p>The public library and Nallur Kandaswamy Temple are iconic, both for their architecture and cultural importance.</p>

<h2>7. Matara (Mirissa)</h2>
<p>Mirissa offers whale watching, turquoise waters, and bohemian beach caf√©s. Matara itself has ancient temples and a laid-back vibe. Surf, snorkel, or party under the stars in one of Sri Lanka‚Äôs liveliest coastal districts.</p>
<p>Wake up early to catch blue whales and dolphins off the coast ‚Äî one of the few places in the world you can do so.</p>
