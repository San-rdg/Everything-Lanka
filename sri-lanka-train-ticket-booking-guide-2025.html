  <h2>How to Buy Train Tickets in Sri Lanka (2025 Guide)</h2>


<section class="section">
  <h2>üöâ Sri Lanka Railways: How It Works</h2>
  <p>Sri Lanka‚Äôs railway network connects major cities, tourist destinations, and hidden gems. The system includes both electrified and diesel lines, covering scenic routes through tea estates, coastal stretches, and cultural landmarks.</p>
  <p>The most popular lines include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Colombo ‚Äì Kandy ‚Äì Badulla (Upcountry Line)</strong>: Famous for its views and cool mountain air.</li>
    <li><strong>Colombo ‚Äì Galle ‚Äì Matara (Coastal Line)</strong>: A beautiful ride hugging the southern coast.</li>
    <li><strong>Colombo ‚Äì Anuradhapura ‚Äì Jaffna (Northern Line)</strong>: Vital for northern access.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h2>üñ•Ô∏è Booking Online</h2>
  <p>Online booking is available for **reserved seats only**. Here‚Äôs what you should know:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong><a href="https://seatreservation.railway.gov.lk" target="_blank">seatreservation.railway.gov.lk</a></strong>: Official government site, accepts Sri Lankan NIC/passport.</li>
    <li><strong><a href="https://12go.asia/en/sri-lanka" target="_blank">12Go Asia</a></strong>: Great for tourists with card payments and confirmations by email.</li>
    <li><strong><a href="https://exporail.lk" target="_blank">Exporail & Rajadhani</a></strong>: Luxury and private train services with air conditioning, meals, and extra luggage space.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Online seats can be booked up to **30 days in advance**. During holidays or weekends, book early to avoid disappointment.</p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h2>üè¢ Buying at Stations</h2>
  <p>For spontaneous travel or unreserved tickets, head to your nearest railway station.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Colombo Fort Station</strong>: Largest and most connected hub in Sri Lanka.</li>
    <li><strong>Reservation Counters</strong>: Usually separate from regular ticket counters. Opens at 5:30 AM on weekdays.</li>
    <li><strong>Tourist Ticket Counters</strong>: Ask staff if you qualify for special allocations on scenic trains.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Unreserved class is cheap but gets crowded. If you're traveling with luggage or kids, reserved seating is highly recommended.</p>
</section>

<section class="section">

    <li><strong>3rd Class</strong>: Cheapest option. Often very crowded but a real local experience.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Some trains also offer <strong>Observation Cars</strong> at the rear/front, especially on the Kandy‚ÄìElla route. Book these early for the best views!</p>
</section>

<section class="section">
  <h2>üì± Mobile Apps & SMS Options</h2>
  <p>The official Sri Lanka Railways app is in development. However, these platforms are useful:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Mobitel mTicketing</strong>: Book via SMS if you use a Mobitel SIM.</li>
    <li><strong>Dialog Rail Booking</strong>: Book train tickets with Dialog through the Genie app or SMS service.</li>
  </ul>
</section>
