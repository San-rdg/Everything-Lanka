      <p class="meta">Updated: <time datetime="2025-08-17">August 17, 2025</time> · Practical guide for visitors: which apps work, cross-border wallet support (UPI/Alipay+), merchant coverage, fees, safety and troubleshooting.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Direct answer block: great for featured snippet -->
    <section class="direct" aria-live="polite">
      <strong>Quick answer:</strong>
      <p><strong>Can tourists use LankaQR?</strong> — Yes. Many LankaQR merchants accept cross-border mobile wallets (e.g., via UPI or Alipay+ integrations) and bank/co-branded solutions that let visitors pay without a local bank account. For best results use a supported wallet/app while keeping a small amount of cash as backup.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="why-lankaqr" class="section">
      <h2>What is LANKAQR and why it matters for tourists</h2>
      <p>LANKAQR is Sri Lanka’s national QR payment standard (launched by the Central Bank and implemented through LankaPay and licensed financial institutions). It standardizes QR payments so customers can scan a merchant’s code and pay directly from their bank or wallet app — a fast way to avoid carrying cash. <!-- source: Central Bank / LankaPay --> </p>
      <div class="features" aria-hidden="false">
        <div class="feature-card">
          <h3>Why it helps travelers</h3>
          <p>Easy contactless payments, low hardware requirement for merchants, and growing cross-border wallet support mean more places accept QR payments — from cafes and shops to tour operators in tourist towns.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-card">
          <h3>Interoperability</h3>
          <p>The LANKAQR standard is designed for interoperability among Sri Lankan bank apps and, increasingly, partnered international wallets — so tourists from India, China and elsewhere can use compatible apps in many merchant locations.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

    <!-- How to pay -->
    <section id="how-to-pay" class="section">
      <h2>How to pay with LANKAQR — step by step (tourist friendly)</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Check the merchant</strong> — look for the <em>LANKAQR</em> sticker or a printed QR at the till.</li>
        <li><strong>Open your app</strong> — use a LankaQR-enabled Sri Lankan bank app or an international wallet that is integrated via UPI/Alipay+ / Mastercard arrangements (if available to you).</li>
        <li><strong>Scan</strong> — tap the app’s scan function and point it at the merchant’s QR code. The merchant details and amount should appear.</li>
        <li><strong>Confirm amount</strong> — verify the amount and merchant name, then approve the payment in your app. Save a screenshot of the confirmation.</li>
        <li><strong>Ask for a receipt</strong> — good practice especially if you need to report disputes later or claim expenses.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><em>Pro tip:</em> if a merchant does not automatically display the amount, ask them to enter it before you confirm.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Where accepted & apps -->
    <section id="where-accepted" class="section">
      <h2>Where LankaQR is accepted — tourist hotspots and merchant coverage</h2>
      <p>Adoption has been growing across Sri Lanka — especially in urban centres and tourist hotspots (Colombo, Kandy, Galle, Mirissa, Arugam Bay), and at many small merchants and tour operators due to the low cost of QR acceptance. Partnerships and integrations have extended acceptance to hundreds of thousands of merchant points nationwide. <!-- source: LankaPay / Alipay+ news --> </p>

      <h3>Which apps & wallets work?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Local bank mobile apps (commercially issued LankaQR apps from licensed banks).</li>
        <li>Cross-border wallet integrations (UPI/PhonePe, Alipay+, and co-branded solutions) that allow foreign wallets to scan LANKAQR where enabled.</li>
        <li>Special tourist / co-branded offers (watch for Pay Local / co-branded debit wallet solutions that target foreign visitors).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Availability depends on recent integrations and promotions — always check your app’s documentation and the merchant’s displayed QR type.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Fees & merchant costs -->
    <section id="fees" class="section">
      <h2>Fees, MDR and what tourists should know</h2>
      <p>Transaction costs are generally controlled by the wallet or bank. Some Sri Lankan banks have run promotional fee waivers for merchants (so merchants may not pass on MDR), while other apps may charge foreign exchange or processing margins for cross-border payments. Always check the payment confirmation and your app's exchange rate / fees before approving. <!-- source: HNB announcement / bank pages --> </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Security & troubleshooting -->
    <section id="security" class="section">
      <h2>Security & troubleshooting</h2>
      <p>LANKAQR is built on industry QR standards and uses bank-level controls; still follow basic precautions: verify merchant name, keep payment screenshots, and avoid approving unexpected amounts. If a payment fails, retry once and ask the merchant to confirm they received the transaction ID; if still unresolved, contact your wallet/bank support. <!-- source: CB S L / LankaPay general guidance --> </p>

      <h2 id="faq-title">FAQ — (answers that search engines love for narrow queries)</h2>

      <details>
        <summary>Can a foreign tourist pay using LankaQR without a Sri Lankan bank account?</summary>
        <p>Maybe — cross-border wallet integrations (for example UPI or Alipay+) and some co-branded tourist wallets can let foreign cards/wallets transact at LankaQR merchants. If you do not have a supported wallet, carry a card or local cash as backup.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Do Indian UPI apps and PhonePe work with LankaQR?</summary>
        <p>There have been integrations to allow UPI-based payments through LANKAQR in selected deployments enabling Indian tourists to pay via UPI/PhonePe where supported. Check your app for explicit LankaQR/UPI coverage before relying on it fully. <!-- source: economyNext / LankaPay partnerships --> </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>How widely accepted is LANKAQR in Colombo and tourist towns?</summary>
        <p>Adoption is extensive and expanding — large numbers of merchants across the island accept LANKAQR, especially in popular tourist areas. However, acceptance still varies for remote locations and very small vendors; keep small cash for those cases. <!-- source: LankaPay / Alipay+ rollout news --> </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Are LankaQR payments safe for tourists?</summary>
        <p>Yes — LANKAQR follows recognized QR payment standards and is regulated. Use official apps, confirm merchant names, and keep payment receipts to reduce fraud risk. <!-- source: Central Bank / technical standards reference --> </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>What should I do if a merchant can't accept my QR payment?</summary>
        <p>Try another app, ask the merchant to reprint/refresh their QR, or pay by card/cash. If you were charged but the merchant didn't receive funds, keep screenshots and contact your wallet/bank support immediately.</p>
