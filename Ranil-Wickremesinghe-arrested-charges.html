  <p class="meta">Event date: Aug 22, 2025 ‚Ä¢ Jurisdiction: Sri Lanka</p>
  <p>Police arrested former President Wickremesinghe and a court remanded him over an allegation that public funds were misused for an overseas trip connected to a university event. He has denied wrongdoing through party allies. Proceedings are ongoing; there is <strong>no conviction</strong> at this time. See reporting and official updates below.</p>

<h2>Major allegations & inquiries (history)</h2>

<div class="case">
  <h3>1995‚Äì1998: Batalanda Special Presidential Commission <span class="badge">Status: No prosecution</span></h3>
  <p class="meta">Subject: Alleged unlawful detention/torture facility; political violence era</p>
  <p>A Special Presidential Commission examined claims surrounding a facility in Batalanda. Contemporary summaries state the Commission recommended depriving Wickremesinghe of civic rights for purported complicity. However, no prosecution or civic-disability order followed, and he continued to hold office in subsequent years. The report itself was later tabled in Parliament; English copies circulate via archives.</p>

  <p class="meta">Subject: Irregular bond auctions; Arjuna Mahendran & Perpetual Treasuries</p>
  <p>A Presidential Commission of Inquiry and Parliament‚Äôs COPE identified serious wrongdoing, chiefly involving then‚ÄìCentral Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran and Perpetual Treasuries Ltd. Wickremesinghe, as Prime Minister who appointed Mahendran, <em>testified</em> before the Commission. Implementation updates and forensic audits were later published by the Central Bank. There were <strong>no criminal charges</strong> against Wickremesinghe personally arising from these inquiries.</p>

  <h3>2019: Easter Sunday attacks ‚Äì oversight & accountability <span class="badge">Status: Institutional failings identified</span></h3>
  <p class="meta">Subject: Security/intelligence failures; institutional responsibility</p>
  <p>Parliament‚Äôs Select Committee (PSC) detailed systemic security lapses preceding the attacks. In 2023, the Supreme Court held former President Maithripala Sirisena and senior officials liable to pay compensation for fundamental rights violations. The judgments and PSC report do <em>not</em> impose personal liability on Wickremesinghe, though governance during his premiership was scrutinized.</p>

  <p class="meta">Subject: Freedom of assembly & expression; PTA/ICCPR Act use</p>
  <p>Rights groups documented excessive force against protesters (notably the July 22, 2022 Galle Face raid, shortly after Wickremesinghe assumed the presidency) and criticized the 2024 Online Safety Act for risks to free expression. These are <em>policy criticisms</em> rather than personal criminal charges.</p>
